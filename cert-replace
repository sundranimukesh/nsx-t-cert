launch Certificate-Manager

/usr/lib/vmware-vmca/bin/certificate-manager
Select Option 1, then Option 2
Provide the paths to 3 files as follows:
nsx_mgr_chain.crt
nsx_mgr.key
ca.crt
import new NSX manager cert to NSX manager
operate NSX manager GUI
Log in to the NSX Manager UI using the VIP IP address.
Navigate to System > Certificates.
Click Import > Import Certificate. The Import Certificate screen is displayed.
In the Name field, enter a unique name for the certificate, such as NSX-VIP-CERT.
In the Certificate Contents field, enter the certificate string. You can locate the certificate string in the nsx_mgr_chain.crt certificate file that you previously generated. Copy and paste the certificate contents of the certificate file into the field.
In the Private Key field, enter your certificate’s private key. You can locate the key string in the nsx_mgr.key private key file that you previously generated. Copy and paste the key content of the key file into the field.
Verify that the Service Certificate option is set to No. The Service Certificate setting should be “off” because you are using the certificate with NSX Manager appliance nodes.
Click Import.
check Certificate ID
verify on each individual NSX Manager node
Log in to each individual NSX Manager node.
On each node, navigate to the System > Certificates screen.
Confirm that the certificate has replicated to the NSX-T Manager instance.
replace existing NSX Manager Certificate with the new certificate
this procedure can be done in any hosts reachable to NSX manager API
export NSX_MGR_VIP="((NSX manager VIP))"
export NSX_MGR_FQDN="((NSX manager FQDN))"
export CERT_ID="((Certificate ID))"

import certificate to VCF trusted store
SSH to SDDC Manager and change to the root user:
ssh vcf@((SDDC manager IP address))
su -
Copy root CA certificate file (ca.crt) to the /tmp directory on the SDDC Manager VM.
Run the below command to get commonsvcs truststore password
cat /etc/vmware/vcf/commonsvcs/trusted_certificates.key
Use the following command to import root CA to commonsvcs truststore:
keytool -importcert -alias vmca -file /tmp/ca.crt -keystore /etc/vmware/vcf/commonsvcs/trusted_certificates.store
When prompted, provide the password to add certificate to truststore obtained in step 3.
Type yes when prompted to trust the certificate
Verify if new root CA is added to common services truststore, enter the password for truststore key obtained in step 3.
keytool -list -v -keystore /etc/vmware/vcf/commonsvcs/trusted_certificates.store
Use the following command to import root CA to sddc manager truststore:
keytool -importcert -alias vmca -file /tmp/ca.crt -keystore /etc/alternatives/jre/lib/security/cacerts
When prompted, provide the password to add certificate to truststore. Default password is "changeit".
Type yes when prompted to trust the certificate.
Verify if new root CA is added to SDDC Manager truststore.
keytool -list -v -keystore /etc/alternatives/jre/lib/security/cacerts
After importing CA certificate to the truststore, restart all the SDDC Manager Services
sh /opt/vmware/vcf/operationsmanager/scripts/cli/sddcmanager_restart_services.sh
